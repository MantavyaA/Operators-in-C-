// RESULTS : 

Input: x = 0, y = 0
Output: The point is at the Origin.

Input: x = 0, y = 5
Output: The point is on the Y-axis.

Input: x = -4, y = 0
Output: The point is on the X-axis.

Input: x = 3, y = 2
Output: The point is in the First Quadrant.

Input: x = -2, y = 4
Output: The point is in the Second Quadrant.

Input: x = -5, y = -7
Output: The point is in the Third Quadrant.

Input: x = 6, y = -3
Output: The point is in the Fourth Quadrant.
